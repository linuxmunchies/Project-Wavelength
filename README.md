# Project Wavelength

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for Project Wavelength, an innovative audio-visual experience crafted with precision and creativity. This project is the brainchild of 'Ride the Wave', a dedicated team operating within CS499 Keystone at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).

Project Wavelength merges the realms of sound and vision, offering an interactive platform where users can engage with dynamically generated visuals driven by live audio inputs or uploaded sound files. Additionally, the project includes user authentication to create a personalized experience.

## Repository Structure

### `/`
The root directory contains the main files of the web application.

- `index.html` - The entry point of the web application. It hosts the user interface for the visual player and the input selection for sound.
- `login.html` - The login page that handles user authentication and redirects to the main page upon successful login.
- `styles.css` - Contains all the styles applied across the web application, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing interface.
- `script.js` - The JavaScript file that manages the interactivity of the main page, including fullscreen functionality and user session handling.
- `login.js` - Dedicated to handling the logic for user authentication on the login page.

### `/icons`
Holds image assets used across the application, such as the fullscreen button icon.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visual Player**: Central feature displaying interactive visuals that react to sound input.
- **Input Selection**: Users can choose between live audio input or uploading a sound file for visual generation.
- **User Authentication**: Includes a basic login/logout system with session storage for user management.

## Development Setup

To get started with Project Wavelength, clone the repository and either use vscode on the directory, and launch Live Server using the Live Server extension, OR open `index.html` in your browser. (This might work for you, it might not.)

For developers:
- When adding new icons or images, place them within the `/icons` directory to maintain organization.
